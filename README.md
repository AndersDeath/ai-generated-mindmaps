## Setting up pgAdmin and PostgreSQL Server

1. Open PgAdmin in the web browser by visiting http://localhost:5050 (assuming we're using the default configuration in the docker-compose.yml file).
2. Log in using your email and password in the docker-compose.yml file for the pgadmin service.
3. In the left-hand sidebar, click Servers to expand the Servers menu.
4. Right-click on Servers and select Register -> Server.
5. In the General tab of the Create - Server dialog, we can give the server a name of our choice.
6. In the Connection tab, fill in the following details:
``` Host name/address: db
    Port: 5432
    Maintenance database: postgres
    Username: postgres
    Password: postgres
```
